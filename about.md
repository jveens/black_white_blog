Jenny is a web developer who enjoys creating interactive experiences that inspire and engage users.

Her preferred tools of the trade are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which she’s used extensively on projects for Yellow Pages, The Artists’ Health Alliance and East United to name a few.

Jenny absorbs knowledge like a sponge. She has a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Queens University, a Bachelor of Arts Honours in Criminology from Carleton University, and a Marketing Post-Grad Diploma from George Brown College. She learned how to code at HackerYou and continues to learn new coding languages in her spare time.

Always up for a challenge, Jenny solves problems using clean, semantic code and solid logic. She believes websites should be beautiful as well as functional, and doesn’t rest until every pixel is perfectly in place. In her spare time, Jenny takes on the bleeding edge of the web, with interests in animation and 3D. She also makes a mean Manhattan.
