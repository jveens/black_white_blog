Outskirts has been built on the ethos that true understanding begins with genuine curiosity. Founded in 2015 by Shawn Topp, Shawn knew he wanted a site that explored this curiosity. So we set out to build a site that would spark the users curiosity and make them want to explore as much as we did. 

The site is a custom WordPress build, with HTML5 and CSS animations sprinkled in. The posts were made to be flexible, and the layout for each can be adjusted by selecting different modules.

    <figcaption>We went back to math class for this atom. Trigonometry played a big role, not only in drawing the ellipses, but also in making the electrons follow their paths.</figcaption>
